<h3 style="text-align:center;">My Experience As A Student</h3>
<p>During my time as a student I have been able to develop the way <strong>I learn and interact</strong> with others to
    a degree that has
    also helped me to <i>mature into a better person</i>. I have come to believe that this maturity will help me to
    develop
    into a <span style="color:blue ;">better thinker as well,</span> one that has the patience to listen and take
    consideration of what others have to
    say. I consider the act of learning a two way avenue that has to be taken seriously. It is one that involves the
    teacher, and the protégé. It has been, and will continue to be, my absolute goal as a student to become a diligent
    protégé and acquire all of learning my teachers have set in front of me. The way each of them have helped me to
    think about how my actions, and the way I choose to study my lessons and develop as a student, has made a tremendous
    impact on my life. This impact is one that I will carry into the future as I myself advance in my professional
    studies</p> <button>read more</button>
